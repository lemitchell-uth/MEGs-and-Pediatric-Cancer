# MEGs-and-Pediatric-Cancer
Analysis of maternal effect genes using data from four Kids First pediatric cancer cohorts

The first goal of this project is to use the KF harmonized data to determine whether mothers of pediatric cancer cases are enriched for predicted damaging/deleterious variants in maternal effect genes (MEGs). Enrichment will be assessed relative to the fathers of cases and possibly against publically available datasets. The list of MEGs in a recent publication (Mitchell 2022) will be used and specific definitions of "damaging/deleterious" will be determined prior to analyses, but will include the likely suspects based on predicted impact, CADD scores etc. Analyses will be conducted separately within cohorts and results will be compared across cohorts. Subsequent analyses will include gene-level assessments including consideration of common variants.

The plan is to conduct analyses within Cavatica. So the first-steps involve learning to work with the KF harmonized data within the Cavatica environment. Initial steps including identifying specific individuals within each trio-based VCF (i.e. mother, father, child/case), extract data for relevant variants, and combining data across VCFs (e.g. all mothers of cases).

Work is progress in "baby-steps" and will be documented here, in detail, so as to help others with little baseline knowledge related to working with KF data, VCFs, Cavatica etc.
